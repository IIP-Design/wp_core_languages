# wp_core_languages
.mo files for wordpress core in different languages


### Directions

With each big version update of wordpress (like from 4.3 to 4.4) it is necessary to download .mo files from here: https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/

Then you must upload the files to this repo. Share's root composer file pulls them into /wp-content/languages
